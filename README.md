## other
Unreasonable demands can be mentioned at will

If there is a better way to make dynamic wallpaper, welcome to discuss and share

This software as a learning function, can put forward some reasonable and unreasonable needs, will do it when there is time

We are on the way to improve our coding ability,

At present: replace the native DDE desktop with the compiled transparent DDE desktop at run time

Draw dynamic wallpaper, use hard decoding, at present the highest support double screen (the function is relatively simple)

It will be updated in recent months
